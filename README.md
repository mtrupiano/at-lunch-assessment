# Developers at Lunch (Spring 2025 engineering role frontend homework)

#### Submitted by [Mark Trupiano](https://mtru-portfolio-next.netlify.app/)

This is my submission for a take-home assessment for a frontend engineering role in Spring of 2025. This project was completed on my own over about a week. If you are interested in running this project please feel free to reach out mtrupiano2@gmail.com

## Deployed

https://at-lunch-assessment.vercel.app/

## Local

1. Clone code from https://github.com/mtrupiano/at-lunch-assessment
2. Copy environment variables into a `.env` file at project root

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Google Maps API key to use latest version of [JavaScript API and React implementation](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/streamline-the-use-of-the-maps-javascript-api-within-your-react-applications/) (personal key, reach out to mtrupiano2@gmail.com for access)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_STYLE_ID` - Style ID to enable [cloud-based styling](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/), **required** when using [Advanced Markers](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/docs/api-reference/components/advanced-marker) (personal, reach out to mtrupiano2@gmail.com for access)

3. Install dependencies: `npm i` or `npm install`
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

## Testing

`npm run test`

## Write Up

Overall I had a great time making this project! I tried adding some bonus fun features while also incorporating all of the functionality I worked out from the designs. I definitely made some autonomous design decisions that if this were an actual work project I would want to discuss with product designers and/or stakeholders, but I think I got all of the major functionality covered.

### NextJS, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS

I chose to build this project in NextJS / React with TailwindCSS for styling. The NextJS platform is well documented and requires minimal configuration for getting a React application up and running. As for styling, I’ve found that TailwindCSS allows for really rapid prototyping compared to relying on a 3rd party component library. It also enforces more uniformity with minimal configuration out-of-the-box as opposed to relying on in-line styles or other styling frameworks.

### Searching

Calls NextJS server action to hit Google Places (Legacy) API. This is an old version of the API but I chose to still use it to try and stick with the project specifications (as much as I could, see below…). Unfortunately the legacy API does not have any typing libraries available, so I ended up manually writing types for data objects returned from this API as copied from the [API’s documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-text#text-search-responses).

### Google Maps React

I had trouble getting the provided API key to work when putting a google map instance in my react app. In order to use the [latest google maps react implementation](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/streamline-the-use-of-the-maps-javascript-api-within-your-react-applications/) I had to make my own personal Google Maps API key. Please reach out to me if you need this key.

### State management

When designing this app I knew I would have to rely on passing around state between components in order to keep track of things like search results and the selected restaurant. I initially started out with state objects but eventually moved to context providers when passing around the state got too unwieldy.

### Bookmarking

I wanted to implement bookmarking but wanted to avoid creating a database for the sake of minimizing the project’s scope. I chose to use localStorage just as a prototype / proof of concept. I mainly rely on a state object to keep track of bookmarked restaurants while the app is in use but write to localStorage on a slightly less reactive basis (debounced) to avoid excessive writes.

### Infinite scroll pagination

Using [`react-intersection-observer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer); when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list view the intersection observer will call another server action with a `nextPageToken` to get the next page of search results from the Places API.

## Attributions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
